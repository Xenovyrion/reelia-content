# Release notes

## 0.16.0 — July 14, 2026
### ✨ New
- New local search in Shows/Movies: text search across your own library (title or episode name) — separate from the existing TMDB search used to find new titles to add
### 🐛 Fixed
- After adding a show or movie from search, the phone's back button returned to the search results screen instead of the Shows/Movies tab
- The progress ring on grid posters didn't have the same dark backing as Home's ring, making it hard to see against a bright poster
- "Recently watched" sort: a freshly added show could show up first if old watch history already existed for it (e.g. removed and re-added, or TV Time import) — only a watch that happened after the add now counts toward this sort
### 🔧 Improved
- The filter/sort sheet's "Reset" button now applies the reset immediately instead of waiting for a separate tap on "Apply"

## 0.15.2 — July 14, 2026
### 🐛 Fixed
- The filter/sort sheet's "Reset" button didn't reset the sort order back to its default, only the status/genre filters
- Filter/sort sheet: on small screens, the "Apply" button could be out of reach at the bottom with no way to scroll to it — the sheet now has a fixed height with internal scrolling, so the Reset/Apply row always stays visible
- Scroll-to-top on bottom tab tap looked like the whole list was "flying" upward on long lists — it now jumps instantly instead of animating
### ✨ New
- New "Recently watched" sort option in Shows/Movies, based on watch history
- Alphabetical sort now groups titles into per-letter sections (with a "0-9" bucket for titles starting with a digit) instead of one long undifferentiated list
### 🔧 Improved
- Status, genre, recently-added, and recently-watched sorts now apply a secondary alphabetical sort within each group
- Grid view in Shows/Movies optimized for better responsiveness on long libraries
- More precise App Check error message: now distinguishes a rate limit ("too many attempts") from the API being blocked on Google Cloud's side, with a tailored explanation for each

## 0.15.1 — July 14, 2026
### 🐛 Fixed
- Scroll-to-top on bottom tab tap still didn't work in some cases (e.g. Profile → Shows → back to Profile) — the previous fix wasn't enough, the whole mechanism was rebuilt
- Tapping "Update" could get stuck with no feedback if the download failed — the error message the app already computed but never showed is now displayed on screen
### ✨ New
- Added a loading indicator (spinner + "Downloading…" text) during updates, so it no longer looks like nothing is happening
### 🔧 Improved
- Sort (status, alphabetical, genre, recently added) is now part of the filter button in Shows/Movies instead of two nearly-identical buttons in the top bar
- App Check (debug) button: a 60-second cooldown after a failed fetch avoids compounding Firebase's own "too many attempts" rate limit by retrying too fast, and the error message is now translated and clearer. This limit comes from Firebase's own backend and can't be removed client-side — only handled more gracefully

## 0.15.0 — July 14, 2026
### 🐛 Fixed
- Important fix: account deletion was already wiping all data (library, history) before checking whether a fresh sign-in was needed — if the session wasn't recent enough, the data was lost while the account itself survived undeleted. Reauthentication is now always required before anything is touched, for both password and Google accounts
- The TV Time import link could open the TV Time app itself instead of a browser — it now forces the default browser
- Tapping a bottom tab didn't always scroll back to the top — it now always does
### ✨ New
- New sort menu in Shows/Movies: by status, alphabetical, genre, or recently added
- Track special episodes ("Specials", season 0) — without them counting toward a show's completion percentage
- "Learn more" now shows a presentation of the app, separate from the user guide
### 🔧 Improved
- The Profile tab is now split into Settings and Stats sub-tabs instead of one long screen
- Language picker only offers French/English, the only languages with real translated text
- The "data source" section is hidden while there's only one provider (TMDB)
- Sign-up verification email temporarily disabled (was landing in spam without a dedicated sending domain)
- GitHub release titles now include the version number

## 0.14.0 — July 14, 2026
### ✨ New
- Safer, simpler account deletion: when Firebase requires a recent sign-in, the app now offers to confirm right there with your password (or a fresh Google sign-in) instead of forcing a full sign-out/sign-in
- Password strength indicator at sign-up, with a minimum of 8 characters required
- Eye icon on password fields to reveal what you typed
- Verification email sent automatically on sign-up
- The "Learn more" button on the sign-in screen now opens an in-app presentation (same look as the guide) instead of a GitHub page
### 🐛 Fixed
- After signing out or deleting your account, the sign-in screen kept the previously typed email and password instead of being blank

## 0.13.3 — July 14, 2026
### ✨ New
- Home now has two sections, "Favorite Shows" and "Favorite Movies" — favoriting a title used to not show up anywhere
### 🐛 Fixed
- After resetting the library, the stats at the top of the Profile tab could briefly flash inconsistent numbers before settling at zero
### 🔧 Improved
- Search screen: title and year are now centered under the poster, with no wasted blank line when the title fits on one line (up to 3 lines for long titles)
- Profile tab: the "Save", "Check for updates" and "Release notes" buttons are now centered; the "Help" button moved into the top bar so it's visible without scrolling to the bottom
- Removed the temporary diagnostic code added to track down the crash fixed in 0.13.1

## 0.13.2 — July 14, 2026
### 🐛 Fixed
- The release notes' "Current" badge stayed stuck on the newest published version instead of following the version actually installed — it now tracks your version, and newer entries get a distinct "New version" badge
- On launch, an "empty library" text could briefly flash while the suggestions were still loading — Home now keeps the animated loading icon up until the content is actually ready
### 🔧 Improved
- Cleaned up a few deprecated technical bits (icons, APIs) flagged by Android Studio, no visible impact

## 0.13.1 — July 14, 2026
### 🐛 Fixed
- The app could crash right after signing in on a freshly reset library, before the TMDB API key had time to sync back down
### 🔧 Improved
- Native Android back gesture (edge swipe) support
- Internal app naming cleanup for consistency

## 0.13.0 — July 14, 2026
### ✨ New
- In-app announcements: an important message can show as a banner or a popup on launch, published directly on GitHub without a new app version
- New **Help** screen (Profile): the user guide is now readable in-app, formatted into color-coded sections instead of plain text
- Remove a show or movie from the library directly from its detail screen (trash button, with confirmation)
### 🐛 Fixed
- The add button on Search results now navigates straight to the added title's detail screen; going back returns to the Series/Films home instead of the Search screen
- Resetting the library then uninstalling/reinstalling the app could bring old shows back and auto-sign you in — Android's default auto-backup, which was restoring a stale local copy, is now disabled
### 🔧 Improved
- The back arrow has a more polished look across every screen that uses it
- In-app updates now follow real version numbers instead of triggering on every new commit
- Stronger protection on Auth/Firestore access (Firebase App Check)

## 0.12.0 — July 13, 2026
### ✨ New
- Library is split back into two dedicated tabs, Séries and Films, each with its own filter, search, and grid/list toggle — searching from Séries only searches shows, and from Films only movies
- The Search screen is fully redesigned to match the rest of the app (poster cards, sections), with a clear button and a genre filter
- Home now has a search button (covering both series and movies) and an "Upcoming" section, matching Séries/Films
### 🔧 Improved
- Search no longer fires a network call on every keystroke: longer debounce and a 2-character minimum before it queries

## 0.11.0 — July 13, 2026
### ✨ New
- Person pages now show an Awards & Nominations section (via Wikidata, since TMDB has no awards data)
- Show/movie pages now have a clickable Crew section (director, writer, composer, creator) alongside Cast — tap through to their person page just like an actor
- Home's greeting now reflects the time of day and your first name when signed in, instead of a flat "Bonjour"
### 🐛 Fixed
- The in-app update could fail to install with a generic "problem with the app file" error and no way to understand why — a failed download is now caught and shown as a real, retryable error
- Home's discovery rows (and the person page's filmography) shifted around while scrolling because card height varied by title length — every card now reserves a consistent height
- The Continue Watching progress ring and episode text could become unreadable on a bright/light backdrop image — both now sit on a dark scrim so they stay legible regardless of the artwork
### 🔧 Improved
- Cast/Crew rows widened so full names are actually readable instead of truncated to a few letters
- Crew job titles (Director, Writer, Composer, Creator) are now translated instead of always showing the raw English TMDB term

## 0.10.0 — July 13, 2026
### ✨ New
- Home is now a discovery hub instead of repeating the Library grid: Suggestions based on your library, Trending Now, and Latest Movie/Show Releases, alongside Continue Watching — all via TMDB, no paid third-party service
- Person pages now show a full filmography (TMDB combined credits), with posters linking to each title
### 🐛 Fixed
- Dates (birthday/death date, upcoming release dates) were shown as raw ISO strings instead of following the app's language — a French device would still see "1955-01-18" instead of "18 janvier 1955"
- A long character name on a filmography poster could push the release year off-screen
### 🔧 Improved
- Person pages redesigned into cards (biography, filmography), matching the show/movie detail screens
- An actor/actress biography now falls back to English when TMDB has no translation for the app's language, instead of showing an empty biography

## 0.9.0 — July 13, 2026
### ✨ New
- Tapping an episode opens a detail sheet with its image, title, air date, rating, and overview
- Checking an episode now auto-fills every earlier unwatched episode in the season (catch-up); long-press a checkmark to toggle just that one episode individually
### 🐛 Fixed
- The season "mark all watched" checkmark only ever marked watched — tapping it while the season was fully watched now un-marks the whole season
- The episode detail sheet's mark-watched button could get stuck reflecting a stale state and stop responding to repeated taps
- The episode detail sheet could cut off the mark-watched button on long overviews — its content now scrolls
### 🔧 Improved
- Episode list rows redesigned as cards with a clearer watched state
- Show/movie detail "About" sections split into cards (overview, schedule, cast, watch providers), matching the Stats screen's look

## 0.8.0 — July 13, 2026
### ✨ New
- Charts (weekly/monthly/weekday) are now tappable to reveal a bar's exact value
- The "Shows by status" breakdown now opens a detail view, same as genres and networks
### 🐛 Fixed
- The theme followed the phone's system light/dark setting instead of always using the dark "Aubergine" theme — on a phone in light mode, the app rendered in very different, unfinished-looking colors
- Genre/network detail panels were capped in height and didn't show the full list — they now open full-screen, fully scrollable
### 🔧 Improved
- Favorite genres ranking now shows 10 genres instead of 5
- Detail lists (genre/network/status) are now sorted alphabetically

## 0.7.0 — July 13, 2026
### ✨ New
- "Reset library" button in Profile > Account
- App version and release notes are now viewable in Settings
### 🐛 Fixed
- The TV Time import screen got stuck at 100% (cloud sync was blocking the summary screen)
- Resetting the library was very slow (documents were deleted one at a time)
### 🔧 Improved
- Profile buttons now line up in a uniform grid
- More readable stat numbers (thousands separators, no more overflow)
- Total watch time now shown as months/days/hours
- TV Time import screen: shorter text, direct link to gdpr.tvtime.com, collapsible details

## 0.6.0 — July 13, 2026
### ✨ New
- Import your library from TV Time: shows, movies, and watch history, automatically matched on TMDB
### 🔧 Improved
- Clearer explanation of which file to pick on the TV Time import screen

## 0.5.0 — July 13, 2026
### 🐛 Fixed
- A show/movie's status didn't switch to "Completed" once fully watched
- The "Completed" stat and library-completion percentage stayed stuck at 0
- The "Shows airing" stat stayed stuck at 0
### 🔧 Improved
- Network breakdown stats can now be drilled into, same as genres
- More breathing room across charts and sections

## 0.4.0 — July 12, 2026
### ✨ New
- In-app update checking and installation
- Account deletion
### 🔧 Improved
- Redesigned login screen (logo, gradient, Google sign-in)
- Sync extended to followed shows/movies, watched episodes, and the watch log
- Stats and Settings merged into a single Profile tab
- Richer stats charts (estimated time remaining, weekly average, breakdown by status/network/day)

## 0.3.0 — July 12, 2026
### ✨ New
- New "Aubergine" theme (colors, typography, shapes)
- 4-tab navigation: Home, Library, Stats, Settings
- Home screen with a "Continue watching" carousel
- Favorites for shows and movies
- Sign-in and cross-device sync via an account

## 0.2.0 — July 12, 2026
### ✨ New
- Trailers, clickable cast, and a dedicated page for each actor/director
- Networks and broadcast status on the show page
### 🔧 Improved
- All episodes now load as soon as a show is added (reliable progress from the start)
- Redesigned Show and Movie pages

## 0.1.0 — July 11, 2026
### ✨ New
